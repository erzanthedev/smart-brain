## 📋 Overview

Welcome to the **Smart Brain React App** project! 🚀

This project is a web application that uses an AI-powered face detection API from Clarifai to identify faces in images. AI, or **Artificial Intelligence**, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software applications to communicate with each other, enabling the integration of external services like Clarifai’s face detection into your own app.

In this project, I built the **frontend**, **backend**, and **database** to create a full-stack application. This journey allowed me to deepen my understanding of web development by integrating various technologies.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

Here's a breakdown of the technologies and tools I used to build this project:

- **React**: For the frontend, to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: For the backend, to manage server-side logic and API requests.
- **PostgreSQL**: For the database, to store user data securely.
- **Heroku**: To host the database and deploy the application.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable insights and skills in various areas:

- **Single Page Applications (SPA) with React**: Learned how to build SPAs where all the content is served on a single page for a seamless user experience.
- **Page Routing with React**: Utilized states to manage routing between signin, signout, register, and login pages.
- **React States and Components**: Gained experience in creating and managing React states, components, props, and understanding their lifecycle.
- **Connecting to a Face Detection API**: Integrated the Clarifai face detection API, emphasizing the importance of reading and understanding documentation.
- **Frontend-Backend-Database Integration**: Connected the frontend with the backend and the database, keeping them separate to maintain a clear structure and improve scalability.
- **Security with npm Packages**: Used npm packages like `bcrypt` to secure passwords on the backend, ensuring user confidentiality and privacy during login.
- **Database Management**: Learned how to create and query databases, using SQL to manage and retrieve data effectively.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to learn how to build a fully functional, full-stack application from scratch. By working on both the frontend and backend, I gained a holistic understanding of how web applications work and how different components interact with each other. This project was a comprehensive test of my React skills and my ability to integrate various technologies into a cohesive application.
